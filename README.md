# Bot + API Server

The bot referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot is an app that runs simple and repetitive automated tasks performed by the users, such as customer service or support staff. Examples of bots in everyday use include, bots that provide information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. This is a simple hello world bot and it also can send message to groupchat from meeting.

The API server is used to exchange the access token provided by Teams to get a token for accessing graph resources that you need for your app.  This sample is requesting permission to read the user's profile to display the current logged in user's profile picture.
